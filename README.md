<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Interpreter for a new Script Language is a new high-level dynamically typed, multi-paradigm, interpreted programming language.


Here's what it is:
* Implementing the interpreter with java which features garbage collection, lexical scope, closures, classes, and inheritance.
* Optimizing the traversal of Abstract Syntax Tree and improved the performance by redesigning the Virtual Machine.


Of course, no one programming language will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this language!
